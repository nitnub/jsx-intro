# Introduction to JSX and it's Relation to React

In order to start this code you will need to fork this repo to your personal github then clone that down to your machine.

Once cloned you will need to do the following:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install dependencies as well as starting the react application. Keep in mind we are going to focus only on the JSX aspect instead of the React.
